# PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Revision Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Version**: 2.0 (Revised with Verified Information)

## Changes Made Based on Fact-Checking

### ✅ Key Corrections

#### 1. **AILS-NTUA Title Correction** (Critical)
- **Before**: "SemEval 2025 Winner"
- **After**: "SemEval-2025 Task 8, First in Proprietary Model Category"
- **Reason**: Competition had multiple categories; AILS-NTUA won the proprietary model category specifically
- **Verified Scores**: 85.63% (DataBench), 87.93% (DataBench Lite)

#### 2. **Baseline Numbers Made Transparent**
- **Before**: "vs current SOTA 67.3%, +3.9%"
- **After**: "targeting improvement over Chain-of-Table's reported strong baseline"
- **Reason**: Unable to directly verify exact 67.3%/86.6% numbers from Chain-of-Table paper PDF
- **Added**: Note about reproduction experiments with documented protocols

#### 3. **Results Tables Revised to Target Format**
- **Before**: Presented as definitive results (67.3%, 71.2%, etc.)
- **After**: Marked as "Target" with "To reproduce" for baselines
- **Added**: Clear note that numbers are projections pending reproduction

#### 4. **SemEval-2025 Task 8 Added as Primary Benchmark**
- **Added**: Official verified scores from ACL Anthology
- **Format**: 85.63% (DataBench) / 87.93% (DataBench Lite)
- **Category**: Explicitly noted "Proprietary Model Category"

### 📋 New Sections Added

#### 1. **Research Integrity & Reproducibility** (Major Addition)
Comprehensive 90-line section covering:

- **Baseline Reproduction Protocol**:
  - Chain-of-Table: Fixed seeds, documented model versions, 95% CI
  - AILS-NTUA: Official verified scores, attempt WikiTQ/TabFact reproduction
  - Table-R1: Document TARPO hyperparameters and requirements

- **Verified Facts Section**:
  - ✅ Confirmed information with sources
  - Clear distinction between verified and to-be-reproduced

- **Evaluation Protocol**:
  - Sandboxed execution (whitelist, timeout, memory limits, Docker)
  - Metrics documentation (official scripts for each dataset)
  - Statistical significance (n≥3, bootstrap tests, CI)
  - Code & data release plan (GitHub, Docker, checkpoints)

- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - If baseline reproduction fails
  - If performance targets not met
  - Alternative publication strategies

### 🔧 Minor Refinements

1. **Expected Performance Section**:
   - Added SemEval-2025 Task 8 target: >87%
   - Added reproducibility note

2. **Datasets Table**:
   - Changed "Current SOTA" column to "Reference Baseline"
   - Added note about Chain-of-Table verification
   - Updated SemEval row with official scores

3. **Baseline Comparisons**:
   - Added AILS-NTUA's verified scores (85.63%/87.93%)

4. **Ablation Study**:
   - Changed from definitive to "Target Performance Breakdown"
   - Added "~" to indicate projections

5. **Error Recovery Analysis**:
   - Changed from "Our system's" to "Target Error Recovery Rates"
   - All numbers marked as targets

6. **Conclusion Section**:
   - Complete rewrite with publication strategy
   - Added backup plans
   - Clearer emphasis on hierarchical diagnosis as main contribution

## Verification Sources Used

1. **AILS-NTUA**:
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00435
   - ACL Anthology: SemEval-2025 Task 8 Proceedings
   - ✅ Verified: 85.63%/87.93%, First in Proprietary Model Category

2. **Chain-of-Table**:
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04398
   - OpenReview: ICLR 2024
   - Google Research Blog
   - ⚠️ Specific numbers need reproduction

3. **Table-R1**:
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12415
   - ✅ Verified: TARPO method, 14.36 point improvement claim

4. **DeepSeek-R1 GRPO**:
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948
   - Multiple technical blogs
   - ✅ Verified: Group mean baseline, 40-60% memory reduction

## Impact on Research Plan

### ✅ Positive Changes

1. **More Credible**: Transparent about what's verified vs projected
2. **Reviewer-Friendly**: Comprehensive reproducibility protocol
3. **Risk-Aware**: Multiple backup plans and alternative metrics
4. **Scientifically Rigorous**: Emphasis on statistical significance and CI

### 🎯 Unchanged Core Elements

1. **System Architecture**: All 3 modules remain the same
2. **5 Core Innovations**: Unchanged (hierarchical diagnosis, hybrid reasoning, GRPO, dynamic budget, explainable trajectories)
3. **Implementation Timeline**: 12-week schedule intact
4. **Code Structure**: Repository layout unchanged
5. **Technical Approach**: GRPO, 4-layer diagnosis, 20+ strategies all still core

### 📊 Adjusted Expectations

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| WikiTQ Target | 71.2% (claimed definitive) | >70% (acknowledged as target) |
| Baseline Reference | "SOTA 67.3%" | "Chain-of-Table (to reproduce)" |
| AILS-NTUA Score | "65.0%" (incorrect) | "85.63%/87.93%" (verified) |
| Publication Confidence | Assumed SOTA achievable | Realistic with backup plans |

## Recommendations for Implementation Phase

### Week 1-2 (Immediate):
1. **Priority 1**: Reproduce Chain-of-Table baseline
   - Use official implementation
   - Document exact environment and seeds
   - Record all hyperparameters

2. **Priority 2**: Verify SemEval-2025 eval scripts
   - Download official DataBench evaluation code
   - Test with AILS-NTUA's reported setup

3. **Priority 3**: Setup Docker environment
   - Freeze all dependencies
   - Create reproducible sandbox

### Week 3-4 (Baseline Phase):
1. Run Chain-of-Table on all 4 datasets
2. Compare with reported numbers (hypothesis: should be close)
3. If gap >2%: Debug setup, check model versions, review prompts
4. If gap persists: Document discrepancy and use your numbers as baseline

### Week 11 (Paper Writing):
1. **Results Section**:
   - Table 1: Your numbers vs your reproduced baselines
   - Add footnote explaining reproduction process
   - Include CI and statistical tests

2. **Discussion**:
   - Address any reproduction challenges
   - Emphasize relative improvements
   - Highlight error recovery and efficiency

## Summary

The revisions transform PROJECT_SUMMARY.md from an **optimistic research proposal** to a **publication-ready research plan** with:

✅ Verified facts clearly marked
✅ Transparent about projections
✅ Comprehensive reproducibility protocol
✅ Risk mitigation strategies
✅ Publication backup plans
✅ Realistic but ambitious targets

**The core research idea remains excellent and novel.** The changes simply ensure the work can withstand rigorous peer review at top-tier venues like ACL/EMNLP/NAACL.

---

**Key Takeaway**: Your "魔改杂糅" approach is still **very strong and novel**. We've just made sure every claim is either verified or clearly marked as a target to be measured. This is exactly what top-tier reviewers expect.

🚀 **Ready to implement with confidence!**
